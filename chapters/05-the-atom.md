# Chapter 5 — The Atom: Structure, Energy, and Uncertainty

**TL;DR:** The atom is mostly empty space. A tiny nucleus holds almost all the mass. Electrons don't orbit in fixed paths—they exist as clouds of probability, constrained by quantization and fundamental uncertainty.

## Chapter Opening: The Foil That Couldn't Be

December 1908. Ernest Rutherford's laboratory at Manchester. A narrow beam of alpha particles—helium nuclei stripped of electrons, hurled by radium decay—fires at a sheet of gold foil thinner than a human hair. Outside, a phosphorescent screen catches the particles as they emerge. Most pass straight through, barely deflected. This is what *should* happen. The accepted plum pudding model says the atom is a uniform sphere of positive charge with electrons scattered throughout, like raisins in pudding. When high-speed particles punch through soft stuff, you expect slight deflection, predictable scattering.

Then Geiger and Marsden, Rutherford's collaborators, see something impossible. A few particles bounce *backward*. Some scatter at sharp angles. One in eight thousand bounces nearly straight back—as if the foil had fired the bullet at itself.

"It was quite the most incredible event that has ever happened to me in my life," Rutherford would later write. And not because of the result itself. Because of what the result meant: everything he thought he knew about the atom was wrong.

What you're about to learn changed physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering. It revealed that atoms are almost entirely vacuum. It explained why some elements decay, why the sun shines, why chemistry even works. But first: watch what the scattering actually shows.

## Concept 1: The Nucleus Discovered

### The Mechanism: What Scattering Actually Measures

In the plum pudding model, the atom is a ball maybe 10^-10 meters across, with charge spread evenly throughout. If you fire a high-speed alpha particle through such a thing, it experiences a weak, distributed repulsive force. Its trajectory bends slightly, like a baseball thrown through a fog of air resistance. Most particles should be deflected a little. Some might be deflected a lot, but *bouncing backward* should be statistically impossible—the way a bullet fired at tissue paper shouldn't ricochet back at you.

Yet it did.

Here's the key: scattering angle tells you about force distribution. If all the repulsive charge in a gold nucleus is concentrated in a tiny region—not spread out—then an alpha particle can approach that concentrated charge very closely. When it does, the electrostatic repulsion becomes *enormous*. The math is Coulomb's law:

$$F = k \frac{|q_1||q_2|}{r^2}$$

The force depends on 1/*r*^2. When *r* becomes very small—when the alpha particle nearly touches that concentrated charge—the force goes sky-high. And a sky-high repulsive force can send a particle bouncing backward.

Rutherford worked backward from the scattering data. He measured how many particles bounced at different angles. He used probability and geometry to infer where the charge must be concentrated. The conclusion: *all* the positive charge in a gold atom lives in a region roughly 10^-15 meters across. That's 100,000 times smaller than the atom itself.

The atom, then, is not a plum pudding. It's a nucleus—a tiny, dense core of protons—surrounded by mostly empty space where electrons live.

**The specification:** A *nucleus* is the tiny, positively charged core of an atom containing essentially all the atom's mass and positive charge. It is 1/100,000 the size of the atom but holds 99.97 percent of its mass.

### Trade-off: Density and Stability

Here's where the puzzle deepens. If the nucleus is that small and that dense, what holds it together? The protons inside repel each other electrostatically. They should fly apart. But they don't. That fact alone—that nuclei exist at all—reveals a new force: the strong nuclear force. We'll defer its details, but note: the nucleus sits at the intersection of two competing forces. Proton-proton repulsion wants to blow the nucleus apart. A short-range strong force wants to hold it together. For most elements, that balance is stable. For heavy elements like uranium, the repulsion sometimes wins, and we get radioactive decay. The tension between these forces is fundamental to nuclear physics.

### Worked Example: Gold Foil Scattering

A gold nucleus has charge +Z*e*, where *Z* = 79 (gold's atomic number) and *e* = 1.602 × 10^-19 coulombs. An alpha particle has charge +2*e*. When an alpha particle approaches the nucleus head-on, its kinetic energy converts to electric potential energy as the nucleus repels it. At the distance of closest approach, all kinetic energy becomes potential energy.

Set initial kinetic energy equal to final potential energy:

$$KE_0 = k \frac{(Z_{\text{Au}} e)(2e)}{r_{\text{min}}}$$

$$\frac{1}{2}m_{\alpha}v^2 = k \frac{Z_{\text{Au}} \cdot 2e^2}{r_{\text{min}}}$$

Suppose an alpha particle has 5 MeV of kinetic energy (typical for decay). Solving for *r_min*:

$$r_{\text{min}} = \frac{k \cdot 2 \cdot 79 \cdot e^2}{\frac{1}{2}m_{\alpha}v^2} = \frac{2k \cdot 79 \cdot e^2}{5 \text{ MeV}}$$

Using *ke*^2 ≈ 1.44 MeV⋅fm (a useful nuclear physics constant):

$$r_{\text{min}} = \frac{2 \cdot 1.44 \cdot 79}{5} \approx 45 \text{ fm}$$

This is the size scale of the nucleus. Rutherford measured the angular distribution of scattered particles and calculated similar distances. The agreement was striking: the Rutherford scattering formula predicted the data beautifully, confirming the nuclear model.

### Common Misconceptions

**"The nucleus is the whole atom."** No. The nucleus is the core. The atom is the nucleus *plus* the electron cloud around it. An atom of hydrogen is a single proton (the nucleus) surrounded by one electron at an average distance of about 10^-10 meters. The nucleus is 10^-15 meters across. The electron doesn't live *in* the nucleus; it lives in the mostly-empty region around it.

**"Rutherford proved electrons orbit the nucleus like planets orbit the sun."** He proved the existence of the nucleus, but the planetary model—where electrons follow fixed circular orbits—runs into problems immediately. If electrons are accelerating as they orbit, they radiate electromagnetic energy and lose energy, spiraling into the nucleus in fractions of a second. Real atoms are stable for billions of years. The planetary model is incomplete.

## Concept 2: Quantization and the Bohr Model

### The Puzzle: Why Does Hydrogen Emit Only Certain Colors?

Boil hydrogen gas in a discharge tube—apply enough voltage to energize it—and light comes out. Pass that light through a diffraction grating, and it separates into its component wavelengths. Here's the puzzle: you don't see a rainbow. You see discrete lines. Specific colors. For hydrogen, the visible lines appear at wavelengths of 656 nm (deep red), 486 nm (cyan-green), 434 nm (violet), 410 nm (far violet). Always the same wavelengths. Always sharp, discrete lines, not a continuous spread.

Why?

If electrons were free to have any energy, we'd expect to see a continuous spectrum. An electron with any energy could radiate away a photon of any wavelength, creating a smooth rainbow from infrared to ultraviolet. But that's not what we see. We see fingerprints—specific, repeating patterns unique to each element.

By the 1880s, Johann Balmer had found a mathematical formula that predicted the wavelengths. It worked beautifully for hydrogen. But *why* that formula? Why those particular wavelengths and no others?

### The Mechanism: Quantized Orbits and Energy Levels

In 1913, Niels Bohr made a radical proposal: electrons in atoms can exist *only* at certain specific energy levels. They are quantized. Not all orbits are allowed. Only certain ones.

Start with Rutherford's nuclear model: electrons orbit a nucleus. Now add Bohr's conjecture: the angular momentum of an orbiting electron can take only discrete values:

$$L = m_e v r = n \frac{h}{2\pi}, \quad n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$$

Here *h* is Planck's constant (6.626 × 10^-34 J⋅s), and *n* is a positive integer—the *quantum number*. The electron can orbit with *n* = 1, or *n* = 2, but not *n* = 1.7. Quantization is absolute.

This single assumption—that angular momentum is quantized—lets Bohr calculate the allowed orbits and their energies. Using Coulomb's law (the force holding the electron to the nucleus) and the constraint on angular momentum, he derived:

$$E_n = -\frac{13.6 \text{ eV}}{n^2}, \quad n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$$

The ground state (*n* = 1) has energy -13.6 eV. The first excited state (*n* = 2) has energy -3.4 eV. The second excited state (*n* = 3) has energy -1.5 eV. (The negative sign means the electron is bound to the nucleus; zero energy means the electron has escaped entirely.)

An electron can jump from one level to another by absorbing or emitting energy—specifically, *exactly* the energy difference between those levels:

$$\Delta E = E_f - E_i = hf$$

where *f* is the frequency of the emitted or absorbed photon, and *h* is Planck's constant.

Now the discrete spectra make sense. When a hydrogen atom is excited (say, by collision or by absorbing a photon), its electron jumps to a higher level. When it falls back down, it radiates away exactly the energy difference as a photon. The wavelength of that photon is fixed by the energy difference:

$$\frac{1}{\lambda} = R \left( \frac{1}{n_f^2} - \frac{1}{n_i^2} \right)$$

where *R* is the Rydberg constant: $R = 1.097 \times 10^7$ m^-1. This is the *Rydberg formula*—the same empirical formula Balmer found decades earlier, now explained from first principles.

### Trade-off: Quantization vs. Classical Physics

Bohr's model succeeds brilliantly for hydrogen. But it has a price: it violates classical physics. In classical physics, charged particles can have any energy—there's no rule forbidding intermediate values. Bohr said: no, there's a quantization rule. Nature permits *only* certain discrete energies.

This was radical in 1913. Where does the quantization come from? Bohr didn't know. He couldn't derive the quantization rule from Maxwell's equations or Newton's laws. He had to *postulate* it. It worked, but the foundation was shaky.

Later, in the 1920s, de Broglie, Heisenberg, and Schrödinger discovered the answer: electrons have wave properties. Quantization emerges naturally when you treat electrons as waves confined to a small space—like standing waves on a vibrating string. Only certain wavelengths fit into a small region. Only certain frequencies are allowed. Only certain energies. Quantization wasn't a mysterious constraint imposed by fiat. It was a consequence of wave mechanics.

### Worked Example: The Hydrogen Spectrum

What is the wavelength of light emitted when an electron drops from the *n* = 3 state to the *n* = 1 state in hydrogen?

Using the Rydberg formula:

$$\frac{1}{\lambda} = R \left( \frac{1}{n_f^2} - \frac{1}{n_i^2} \right) = 1.097 \times 10^7 \left( \frac{1}{1^2} - \frac{1}{3^2} \right)$$

$$\frac{1}{\lambda} = 1.097 \times 10^7 \left( 1 - 0.111 \right) = 1.097 \times 10^7 \times 0.889 = 9.75 \times 10^6 \text{ m}^{-1}$$

$$\lambda = \frac{1}{9.75 \times 10^6} = 1.025 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m} = 102.5 \text{ nm}$$

This is ultraviolet light—you can't see it with your eye. But it's a strong line in hydrogen's emission spectrum, part of the Lyman series (transitions ending at *n* = 1).

### Common Misconceptions

**"Bohr's model is wrong."** It's incomplete, not wrong. For hydrogen and hydrogen-like ions (single-electron systems), Bohr's formulas for energy and wavelength are exact. For multi-electron atoms, it breaks down because electrons interact with each other in ways Bohr's simple model doesn't capture. The model works for what it was designed to do.

**"Electrons orbit in circular paths like planets."** Bohr assumed circular orbits to derive the energy formula. But electrons don't *really* move in circles. They're waves. The orbit picture is a classical analogy that happens to give the right energy levels but misleads us about the actual motion. The quantum model, coming next, fixes this.

## Concept 3: The Quantum Model and Uncertainty

### The Puzzle: Where Exactly Is the Electron?

If you ask a classical physicist, "Where is the electron in a hydrogen atom?", the answer is simple: "It's at radius *r_n* from the nucleus, moving at velocity *v_n* along a circular orbit." You can specify position and momentum precisely.

But in the 1920s, Werner Heisenberg proved this question is *fundamentally* unanswerable. Not because we lack better instruments—because nature itself forbids simultaneous precision in both position and momentum.

### The Mechanism: Wave-Particle Duality and the Uncertainty Principle

De Broglie's insight (1924): Matter has wave properties. An electron with momentum *p* has wavelength:

$$\lambda = \frac{h}{p}$$

Now, a wave isn't localized at a single point. A wave is spread out. If an electron is a wave with wavelength *λ*, then its position is uncertain by roughly *λ*. You can't know where the electron is more precisely than the wavelength of its matter wave.

But here's the trade-off. To measure an electron's position precisely, you need to use a probe with a very short wavelength (high energy). When you do, the probe scatters off the electron, imparting momentum to it. The more precise your position measurement, the more you disturb the momentum. Conversely, if you try to measure momentum precisely (using a low-energy, long-wavelength probe), you can't localize the electron's position.

Heisenberg showed mathematically that this is unavoidable:

$$\Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{h}{4\pi}$$

This is the **Heisenberg uncertainty principle**. The product of the uncertainty in position (*Δx*) and uncertainty in momentum (*Δp*) cannot be smaller than a fundamental constant proportional to Planck's constant.

It's not a measurement error. It's not a flaw in our instruments. It's a feature of reality itself. An electron simply does not have a simultaneous sharp position and momentum. The universe doesn't store that information.

### The Consequence: Orbitals, Not Orbits

If you can't specify an electron's exact position and momentum, you can't specify its orbit. What you *can* do is specify the probability that the electron will be found at each location. The electron exists as a cloud of probability—higher probability near the nucleus, lower probability far away. This cloud is called an **orbital**.

For hydrogen's ground state (*n* = 1), the probability cloud is roughly spherical, centered on the nucleus, with a characteristic size of about 0.5 Ångströms (0.53 × 10^-10 m, called the Bohr radius). The electron is *not* orbiting at a fixed distance; it could be anywhere within that cloud. If you measure its position, you'll find it somewhere—but repeated measurements will scatter around the cloud's shape. The shape itself—the probability density—is what quantum mechanics calculates. It solves the Schrödinger equation to find the orbital shapes and their energies.

For higher *n*, the orbitals are larger and have different shapes. Some are spherical, some are dumbbell-shaped (orbitals called *p* orbitals), some are more exotic. But all of them are solutions to the Schrödinger equation—waves confined to the region around the nucleus, quantized by the same mechanism that quantizes standing waves on a string.

The key insight: quantization emerges naturally from wave mechanics. You don't need to postulate it. It's a mathematical consequence of the Schrödinger equation applied to a particle confined near a nucleus.

### Trade-off: Determinism vs. Probability

Classical physics is deterministic. If you know position and momentum, you can predict the future perfectly (given the forces). Quantum mechanics is probabilistic. You can't predict where a single electron *will* be, only the probability distribution of where it *might* be. This bothered Einstein and many others. "God does not play dice with the universe," he famously objected.

But decades of experiments have confirmed: this is how nature works. The universe at small scales is genuinely probabilistic. Uncertainty isn't ignorance; it's ontological—a feature of reality itself.

### Worked Example: Uncertainty in a Hydrogen Atom

In hydrogen's ground state, the electron is confined to a region roughly the size of the Bohr radius, *a_0* ≈ 0.53 × 10^-10 m. Let's estimate the uncertainty in momentum.

If the electron is confined to a region of size *a_0*, then:

$$\Delta x \sim a_0 = 0.53 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m}$$

From the uncertainty principle:

$$\Delta p \gtrsim \frac{h}{4\pi \Delta x} = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{4\pi \times 0.53 \times 10^{-10}}$$

$$\Delta p \gtrsim \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{6.66 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 0.99 \times 10^{-24} \text{ kg⋅m/s}$$

The electron's momentum is roughly this uncertain. Its kinetic energy is then:

$$KE \sim \frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2m_e} \approx \frac{(10^{-24})^2}{2 \times 9.1 \times 10^{-31}} \approx 5.5 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J} \approx 3.4 \text{ eV}$$

This is in the ballpark of the electron's binding energy (13.6 eV in the ground state). The uncertainty principle guarantees that confinement to a small region requires kinetic energy. You can't "squeeze" the electron into a tiny space for free. The tighter the confinement, the higher the kinetic energy cost. This is why the electron doesn't simply collapse into the nucleus—the uncertainty principle prevents it.

### Common Misconceptions

**"Uncertainty means we're just ignorant."** No. It's built into nature. Electrons don't have definite positions and momenta simultaneously. The property doesn't exist to be unknown.

**"Quantum mechanics is probabilistic because we're missing information."** Not according to every experiment ever done. The probabilities are real. Hidden variables—the idea that the electron "really" has a position and momentum we just can't measure—have been tested and ruled out by Bell's theorem (1964) and its experimental confirmations.

**"Orbitals are orbits that are fuzzy."** No. An orbital is a probability distribution. The electron doesn't follow a path; it exists as a wave. The distinction matters.

## Integration: From Puzzles to Picture

We began with a foil that bounced bullets backward—an impossible result that revealed the nucleus. That led to the Rutherford model: nucleus plus electrons in space.

Then we asked: why do atoms emit only certain colors of light? Bohr's answer was radical: quantization. Only certain orbits are allowed, leading to discrete energy levels and discrete spectral lines. It worked, but it rested on a mysterious postulate.

Finally, we discovered why quantization is real: electrons are waves, not particles. Waves confined to a small region have only certain wavelengths and energies. The Schrödinger equation governs the wave function. The uncertainty principle forbids us from even asking where the electron "really" is. The electron is a cloud of probability—an orbital—not a moving point.

These three layers build on each other. The nucleus explains atomic mass and size. Quantization explains chemical properties and spectra. Uncertainty explains why atoms are stable. Together, they form the modern picture: atoms are tiny nuclei surrounded by electron clouds, held together by the electromagnetic force, constrained by quantum mechanics.

Chemistry is the dance of these electron clouds. When atoms bond, their orbitals overlap and merge. The periodic table emerges from the way orbitals fill. Molecular structure follows from orbital shape. Crystal structure from orbital interactions. Life itself depends on the quantum mechanics of electrons.

All from a foil, a beam, and a backward bounce.

## Exercises

### Warm-up
1. In Rutherford's experiment, why didn't the plum pudding model predict backscattering? What does backscattering reveal about the distribution of charge in an atom?
2. What is quantization? Give an example from hydrogen's spectrum: what is quantized, and what determines the allowed values?
3. Why does the Heisenberg uncertainty principle *not* say we're just bad at measuring things?

### Application
4. An electron in a hydrogen atom transitions from *n* = 4 to *n* = 2. Calculate the energy of the emitted photon (in eV) and the wavelength (in nm). Is this photon visible?

10. Two hydrogen atoms form an H₂ molecule. Their 1s orbitals overlap and merge into bonding and antibonding combinations. Why is the bonding orbital lower in energy? Why does this make the molecule stable?

---

## Chapter Summary

The atom consists of a tiny, dense nucleus surrounded by a cloud of electrons. Rutherford's gold foil experiment revealed the nucleus by measuring how alpha particles scatter. Most scattering is slight; backscattering is rare but reveals that charge is concentrated in a tiny core.

Discrete emission spectra showed that electrons can occupy only certain energy levels. Bohr's model—with quantized angular momentum—predicted the hydrogen spectrum exactly. The Rydberg formula $\frac{1}{\lambda} = R \left( \frac{1}{n_f^2} - \frac{1}{n_i^2} \right)$ connects energy levels to photon wavelengths.

The quantum mechanical model replaced orbits with orbitals: probability clouds described by the Schrödinger equation. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle ($\Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{h}{4\pi}$) explains why electrons don't spiral into the nucleus and forbids assigning a definite position and momentum simultaneously.

Quantization emerges from wave mechanics: confined waves have only certain allowed frequencies and energies. This principle extends beyond hydrogen to all atoms, governing the periodic table, chemistry, and the structure of matter itself.

---

## Connections Forward

**Nuclear physics** (chapter 23) explores the nucleus itself: what holds it together, why some nuclei are unstable, and the enormous energies released in radioactive decay and nuclear reactions.

**Multi-electron atoms** require quantum numbers to specify orbitals: principal quantum number *n* (size), orbital angular momentum *l* (shape), magnetic quantum number *m_l* (orientation), and spin *s*. The Pauli exclusion principle—no two electrons can have identical quantum numbers—explains the periodic table's structure.

**Molecular bonding** occurs when electron orbitals from different atoms overlap. The resulting molecular orbitals are new solutions to the Schrödinger equation. Bonding (lower energy) and antibonding (higher energy) combinations explain chemical stability and reactivity.

**Solid state physics** describes how orbitals in billions of atoms merge into energy bands, leading to conductors, semiconductors, and insulators. This is the foundation of electronics.

---

**What would change my mind:** Evidence that electrons actually do have simultaneous definite position and momentum in atoms (violating the uncertainty principle). Bell's theorem and a century of experiments have ruled this out.

**Still puzzling:** Why Planck's constant has exactly the value it does. It's dimensionally and mathematically essential—quantization would fail without it—but we don't yet understand its origin.

## LLM Exercise — Chapter 22: The Atom (Physics Demonstrations Notebook Project)

**Project:** Physics Demonstrations Notebook.
**What you're building this chapter:** the atomic-spectrum demo — view different light sources through a CD/DVD diffraction grating and observe that gas-discharge sources show DISCRETE emission lines (quantization made visible).
**Tool:** **Claude Project** for the entry.

---

**The Prompt:**

```
Chapter 22 demo. Notebook in this Claude Project. Chapter 22
taught: classical physics predicts atoms collapse (electrons
should radiate energy continuously and spiral into the nucleus
in nanoseconds); the Bohr model (electrons in discrete orbits;
energy quantized); the modern Schrödinger atom (electrons as
probability clouds in orbitals); quantum numbers; the periodic
table as a consequence of quantum-number filling rules.

The chapter's strongest demonstrable claim: atomic emission is
QUANTIZED — atoms emit at specific discrete frequencies, not at
a continuous spectrum. This is direct experimental evidence for
quantum mechanics.

**The Demo:** Use a CD or DVD as a diffraction grating to view
different light sources. Continuous-spectrum sources (incandescent
bulbs, sunlight) give a smooth rainbow. Discrete-spectrum sources
(fluorescent lights, sodium-vapor lamps, neon signs) give a few
bright lines on a dark background — the QUANTIZED emission
spectrum of those gases.

**Materials:**
- A CD or DVD (the data side, shiny).
- Several light sources (the more, the better):
  - An incandescent bulb (continuous blackbody spectrum).
  - A fluorescent light (gas-discharge with phosphor).
  - A compact fluorescent lamp (CFL).
  - A sodium-vapor street light (yellow streetlamps).
  - A neon sign or LED holiday lights of various colors.
  - Direct sunlight (continuous, but with absorption lines —
    Fraunhofer lines from solar atmosphere — visible in really
    careful observation).
- Phone camera for photos.

**Procedure:**

1. Position the CD so it reflects light from the source toward
   your eyes (or the camera).
2. Tilt the CD until you see the diffracted rainbow.
3. Compare different sources:
   - Incandescent bulb: a CONTINUOUS rainbow (smooth gradient
     from red through violet).
   - Fluorescent: rainbow with DISTINCT BRIGHT LINES in red,
     green, blue, yellow.
   - Sodium-vapor: dominantly YELLOW (the famous sodium D-line
     at 589 nm).
   - Neon: red-orange dominated.

4. Photograph each source through the CD. Save the images.

**The interpretation:** the discrete bright lines tell you the
specific wavelengths the gas atoms emit. Each line corresponds
to an electron jumping from one quantized energy level to
another. The pattern of lines is unique to each element — this
is how astronomers identify what stars are made of.

**Use Claude as a thinking partner:**
- Before: "What wavelengths should I expect to see in the visible
  spectrum from a fluorescent light's phosphor mixture?"
- After: "I observed bright lines at approximately X, Y, Z nm.
  Which atomic transitions could produce these? (Hint: hydrogen
  Balmer series gives lines at ~656, 486, 434, 410 nm.)"

**Variation: hydrogen lamp.** If you can borrow a hydrogen
discharge tube from a physics lab, the four visible Balmer lines
are textbook-clear. Without one, fluorescent and CFL bulbs are
the most accessible quantization-demonstrators.

**Notebook entry should include:**
- Photos of the spectra of multiple sources through the CD.
- Description of continuous (incandescent, sun) vs. discrete
  (fluorescent, sodium, neon) emission.
- Identification of approximate wavelengths of bright lines if
  possible.
- One application: spectroscopy is how we determine the
  composition of distant stars and the atmospheres of exoplanets.

End with: why does the hydrogen atom (the simplest atom) produce
exactly the Balmer-series wavelengths it does, and not other
wavelengths? (Hint: Bohr's quantization postulate.)
```

---

**What this produces:** A demo entry showing continuous vs. discrete spectra. The visible difference between an incandescent bulb's smooth rainbow and a fluorescent light's spotted spectrum is the most accessible direct evidence of quantization any student can produce.

**How to adapt this prompt:**

- *For your own project:* The CD diffraction technique works; a more sensitive option is a $5 hand spectroscope from a science-supply store. Or a smartphone camera + a tiny slit.
- *For ChatGPT / Gemini:* Works as written.
- *For Claude Code:* For analyzing the photographed spectra to extract wavelength positions, Claude Code with image processing could do it.
- *For a Claude Project:* Append.

**Connection to previous chapters:** Ch 15's dispersion (Demo B) becomes Ch 22's quantization probe. Ch 21's photons of energy E = hf appear here as discrete emission lines — each line is one transition.

**Preview of next chapter:** Chapter 23 is particle physics — the closer. You'll do a cloud-chamber demo (if possible) or visit public-data displays of cosmic-ray detectors. The chapter's particles are too small for direct demos, but the cloud chamber lets you see their tracks.
